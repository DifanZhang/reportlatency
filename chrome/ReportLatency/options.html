    <form>
    Report to: <i id="default_report_to"></i>

      <input type="url" id="report_to" name="report_to" size="80">
    <br>

      This is where the services and their latencies are sent.  See
      the following options to determine how detailed the services are
      broken down.  localhost sends them only to your local machine,
      which would have to run it's own web service to capture them.

      <p>

	default_as_org
	<input type="checkbox" id="default_as_org" name="default_as_org"
	  value="false">
	<br>

	URLs are reduced to a service name to prevent security issues.
	The default service name '.' reflects the speed of the
	Internet as a whole, but by enabling <i>default_as_org</i>,
	the organization's domain name will be used if no other
	enabled rule is matched.  Examples: <tt>company.com</tt>,
	<tt>ci.city.st.us</tt>.  Only enable this if you're
	comfortable reporting the organization's domain names.

	Send a lot more information to the Javascript console
	(background page) for the extension.  This logs the beginning
	and ending of each event and much of the data provided with
	each event.  It does not log content or cookies of events, but
	does log the full URLs that this extension sees.  Use only if
	developing, debugging, or curious about how the extension
	works.
