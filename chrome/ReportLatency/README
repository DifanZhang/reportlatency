   The Javascript for the extension is broken up into several files to
allow local modification without changing the upstream files, and to
allow unit testing.  The distributed and new files are simply
concatenated in the correct order using the default Makefile target.

In this directory:
   make

   You now have an unpacked extension that may be installed from 
chrome:://extensions, tick Developer mode, and Load unpacked extension...
Provide this directory in the file selector.


   For distribution in your local domain's Chrome web store (don't make
this globally available),

   make ReportLatency.zip

   For local use, you'll probably want to change the local reporting
destination to a secure local service.  eg.

global_example.js
-----------------
  optionDefault['report_to'] =
    'https://reportlatency.example.com/latency/post';


   You may also want to create more detailed service names, for your
internal services that you need distinct latency results for.  An
example of this is google_services.js and google_tests.js.
