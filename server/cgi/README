To install:
  Copy each .pl file to a cgi-bin directory on your server, and rename as you
  wish (strip .pl, rename to .cgi)

  Copy the .pm file to a subdirectory ReportLatency/ in a local perl module
  path.

  Create a data directory alongside your cgi-bin directory, and make sure
  www-data can access it. Create latency.sqlite3 in the data directory by
  executing sqlite3 {path} <latency.sql

  If you want to preserve data across schema updates, manually add new fields
like this:

	ALTER TABLE report ADD COLUMN final_name TEXT;
        ...
